            Who we are: Bigfoot will be a functional cite able to be updated with new articles and news reports of the latest and greatest evidence and probable sightings of the Sasquatch throughout the pacific northwest. The cite will be managed and updated weekly with top stories and past sightings for the viewer to enjoy. The purpose of this cite is to create more of a sense of realism for the audience, that they can read about sightings and reports from their very own towns and areas—the goal of this is to show that these are real people, not just the occasional hoaxers or crazy people but real people that could be in their neighborhoods. Another great addition to the cite is the added links to other prominent cites with more comprehensive sighting report systems, again—the goal stated with this cite is to provide a place for all things bigfoot this includes other cites that may have access to other forms of information such as the BFRO home page, also known as the Bigfoot field researchers organization their ability to take reports and record them is vital to our goal of providing a comprehensive website for all things bigfoot.
