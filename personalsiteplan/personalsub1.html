            Here each week we post three new highlighted reports that we go over in detail, these are picked by our team and share new sightings, as well as old ones that may have been controversial as well to be discussed about and read through in an analyzing and descriptive way. The goal of this is to build the knowledge of our viewers and give them a reason to come back each week to learn new facts and give feedback so that the page can be updated with new material and things the audience would like to see more of and would like to see changed.
