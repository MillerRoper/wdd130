<p>I enjoy reading writing and all things out doors! I am majoring in Sodtware engineering
    and am a sohpmore here at school! I am from Middleton Idaho and grew up on a farm training
    horses with my dad. I played soccer and tennis in highschool as well as continued working with animals.
    I served my Mission in Eugene Oregon and have been home for 6 months. I love meeting people and making 
    friends and am always wanting to do anything and everything. I love working in computers and see them as a 
    very valuable tool to use and understand.
